# AutoMLapp
This project is an application of automated machine learning deployed on a website using streamlit. I used pycaret to select the best model and pandas_profiling to do data analysis and data visualisation. The user should simply upload a csv file and select the type of problem and the app will select the best model to download it for after usecases. there is also a section called nlp for spell check using Transformers.
